When someone says, “REST service,” “REST API” or “RESTful API” they more-than-likely 
mean an HTTP or Web-based server that accepts requests over HTTP 
and responds in human-readable JSON.

REST is an acronym for “REpresentational State Transfer”

curl -i 'https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=radiohead&media=music&limit=3'

We can use ‘curl’ on the command-line as follows. In this case all the query-string 
paremeters on the URL are simply telling the search API what term to search for (radiohead),
 how many results we want returned (3), and the type of media (music)
